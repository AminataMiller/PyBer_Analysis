# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

PyBer, a ride sharing company is conducting an analysis on its data to find the relationship between the type of city, the number of drivers and the count of rides it has provided in order to address disparities.

### Purpose

In this analysis we are creating a summary DataFrame of the ride sharing data by city type and come up with a graph that will show the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

### total rides:
	The analysis found that the Urban cities have a higher share of rides with over 68% compared to Suburban and Rural cities with each 26% and 5%.

### total drivers:
	Also in the same order, Urban cities have a significantly higher number of drivers with 80% of the drivers, Suburban have 16% and 2.6% for Rural cities.

### total fares:
The share of Urban cities in the total fares is 62.7%, 30.5% for Suburban cities an 6.8% for Rural.

### DataFrame summary:
	The DataFrame shows the relationship between the number of drivers, the total rides and the fares in each city type. The total number of drivers is a lot higher in Urban cities, more than its total rides, which in return gives lower average fare per driver whereas Rural cities have a lower driver count and thus higher average fare per driver.

### The graph:
	The graph shows the average fare per city type per week. Looking at it, we can see the same trend, as in the whole analysis, with the Urban city bringing higher total fares, Suburban in second and Rural being lower total fares. But it is worth noting that the same pattern can be observed about the peak and low seasons for all city types being the same with a slight variation.

## Summary

The three business recommendations to address disparities:
1.	Reduce the number of drivers in the Urban cities as they are more than what is needed.
2.	Increase the number of drivers in Rural cities to improve accessibility and affordability.
3.	Have backup drivers for peak seasons.
